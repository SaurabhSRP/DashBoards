# NBA Regular Season Performance Comparison
- NBA Regular Season consists of 82 games and 30 teams compete with each other to mark their place in the playoffs. These 30 teams are grouped into two - Eastern and western Conference and the top 8 teams from the each conference makes to the playoffs 
## Overview
- As a basketball enthusiast myself we always want to compare your Favourite team with the other to prove who is better, this motivated me 
to build this dashboard. 
- Data is captured from the NBA stats official website.
- Few points to keep in the mind is that this dashboard is built for general sports enthu's so avoid using Advance Statistics and keep only 
  the revelant KPIs which everyone looks for.
- re-check the relationships of datasets as it can affect the queries.
- As there are two slicers named Team 1 and Team 2. Make sure that each slicer only filters the required graphs and cards.
