GP: Games played
PPG: Points Scored Per Game
oPPGPoints Allowed Per Game
pDIFF: Points Differential = [(Total Points Scored) – (Total Points Allowed)]/ (Games Played)
PACE: Pace, an estimate of Possessions Per 48 Minutes
oEFF: Offensive Efficiency, points scored per 100 possessions
dEFF: Defensive Efficiency, points allowed per 100 possessions
eDIFF: Efficiency Differential = [(Total Offensive Efficiency) – (Total Defensive Efficiency)]/ (Games Played)
SOS: Strength of the Schedule Opponent efficiency differential average for all games played so far (venue of the games also taken into account) is used as an indicator of the strength of the schedule. The higher the SoS rating, the tougher the schedule; where zero is average
rSOS: Remaining Strength of the Schedule Opponent efficiency differential average for the remaining games (venue of the games also taken into account) is used as an indicator of the strength of the schedule. The higher the rSOS rating, the tougher the remaining schedule; where zero is average

SAR: Schedule Adjusted Rating An evaluation of teams based on efficiency differential and strength of schedule
CONS: Consistency Rating Consistency based on game-by-game efficiency differential variation. The higher the team has consistency rating, the more unpredictable it is
a4F: Adjusted Four Factors, calculated by applying weights to the differentials of offensive and defensive four factors. A4F explains the specified proportion of variability in wins
W: Wins: The most important goal in sports unless your team is not tanking
L: Losses: Total number of games lost
W%: Winning percentage
eWIN%: Correlated Gaussian Expected Winning Percentage, indicates the ideal winning percentage based on offensive and defensive performance
pWIN%: Projected Winning Percentage, each point differential translates to 2.7 wins over the course of the season
ACH: Achievement Level In Terms of Wins, this metric is based on the differential between actual and expected winning percentages. Positive figures indicate overachievement while negative figures indicate the team should have won more games.
STRK: Current Streak, winning or losing streak for the season
